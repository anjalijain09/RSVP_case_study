# RSVP Movies: Data-Driven Strategy for Global Movie Release
## Project Overview

RSVP Movies, a leading Indian film production company with a history of producing blockbuster films, is preparing to release a movie aimed at a global audience in 2022. To ensure the success of this venture, the company seeks to base its decisions on a thorough analysis of data from their previous movie releases over the past three years.

This repository contains the complete analysis conducted using MySQL, which provided valuable insights to guide RSVP Movies in their strategic planning for the global release.

## Repository Structure
- Executive Summary/: A concise report summarizing the key insights and recommendations derived from the analysis.
- IMDB+question/: Contains all the SQL queries used during the analysis. These scripts can be run to replicate the analysis and generate the same insights from the dataset.
- IMDb+movies+Data+and+ERD+final.xlsx: An Excel file containing the Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) and detailed data related to IMDb movies, which were crucial for the analysis.
- IMDb+dataset+import.sql: A SQL script for setting up the initial database. This script imports the dataset into MySQL and creates the necessary tables and relationships for the analysis.

## Key Analysis Areas
1. Market and Audience Insights: Analyzing global market trends and audience preferences to tailor the upcoming release for maximum appeal.
2. Genre Performance: Examining the success of various genres in different regions to guide content creation.
3. Competitive Benchmarking: Comparing RSVP Movies' past performances with other global hits to identify competitive advantages and potential challenges.
